# Obtaining and displaying absolute risks in the context of multiple comparisons

## Description of the repository

The repository offers the typical structure of separate folders for data, and R risks, respectively.
* The _data_ folder includes three input .RData files: baker_published, baker_network, and bdogliotti_afresh;
* The _R_ folder includes three analysis scripts (Network plots.R, Absolute risks_NMA afresh.R, and Absolute risks_NMA results.R) to replicate Figures 1 and 2 and Table 1 of the manuscript, and the script obtain.absolute.risks_function.R to obtain the uniqie absolute risks using the results of a publihed systemati review with network meta-analysis.

After downloading/cloning the repo, the user can use the .Rproj file to source all code.

The next sections briefly illustrate the functions of our novel decision framework for robustness of the primary analysis results with emphasis on the summary treatment effects.
