# Obtaining and displaying absolute risks in the context of multiple comparisons

## Description of the repository

The repository offers the typical structure of separate folders for data, and R risks, respectively.
* The __data__ folder includes three input .RData files: _baker_published_, _baker_network_, and _dogliotti_afresh_;
* The __R__ folder includes three analysis scripts (_Network plots.R_, _Absolute risks_NMA afresh.R_, and _Absolute risks_NMA results.R_) to replicate Figures 1 and 2 and Table 1 of the manuscript, and the script _obtain.absolute.risks_function.R_ to obtain the uniqie absolute risks using the results of a published systematic review with network meta-analysis.

After downloading/cloning the repo, the user can use the .Rproj file to source all code.
